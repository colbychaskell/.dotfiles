## Notes

These are my personal dotfiles that serve as the baseline configuration for my
development environment.

In my daily work, I am forced to use a variety of machines and operating systems
each with unique restrictions and requirements. My goal with these dotfiles is
to create a configuration consisting of the minimum tools I need to work
effectively. As each machine permits, I have added techniques to extend these
configurations without disrupting my baseline configuration files.
